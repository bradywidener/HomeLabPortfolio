# Home Lab Portfolio
This repository is meant to contain my portfolio for my homelab and related projects.

Hello! My name is Brady and I'm a System Administrator based in East Tennessee. This repository contains a somewhat portfolio for my mini homelab projects. I do this to push myself to learn more and to improve on my career. I hope you enjoy. You can find more information about me on my website, [runasadmin.net](https://runasadmin.net).

As far as places to start, I recommend going to the [Overview Page](Overview.md) to learn more about the enviornment I'm running, and then you can navigate through the various folders to find more information on specific projects. 

Cheers!
