Hello! My name is Brady and I'm a System Administrator based in East Tennessee. This repository contains a somewhat portfolio for my mini homelab projects. I do this to push myself to learn more and to improve on my career. I hope you enjoy. You can find more information about me on my website, [link](runasadmin.net).

Cheers!
